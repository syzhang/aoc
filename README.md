## Advent of Code
Solving AOC in Python. Data is stored in `data/` and solutions are in `aoc_xx/`.

### Best things I've leanred
- [Reduce](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html/) - Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.
- [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) - Calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices.
- [Pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) - Calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices and the number of lattice points inside the polygon.
- [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) - Calculate the distance between two points in a grid-like system.
- [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) - Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
- [Scipy.optimize.fsolve](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html) - Find the roots of a function.
